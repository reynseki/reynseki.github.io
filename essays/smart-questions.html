<p>As a computer science major you learn early on that google(for the time being) is your best friend in terms of asking questions related to programming.  Eventually, you notice that the website “StackOverflow” appears over and over again while searching through google and eventually that becomes the go-to resource for all your questions.  The forum is a goldmine for all programmers, as odds are, a question you might have, has been asked and probably answered before.  However, while surfing through stackoverflow questions and the solutions that accompany them, you may notice solutions that look somewhat hostile or users that seem aggressive when answering questions.  This is because while there are close to unlimited people at your disposal when asking a question, that does not mean “stupid” questions are necessarily welcome.  When asking a question you are still expected to do as much research as you can into your issue before posting a question.  Eric Raymond’s essay provides more insight into this and goes in depth on how questions should be structured and the steps that should be taken when formulating a “good” question</p>

<h2 id="the-good-stuff">The Good Stuff</h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed about this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/463368/javascript-close-alert-box">question</a> was that it was very concise and straight to the point.  This user’s issue is stated in the first sentence of the post and afterwards he mentions what he has already researched/tried to avoid any confusion.  Furthermore to be even more specific he states what he does not want.  I think this is a good formulation of a question because it is straightforward and the user makes it as easy as possible for responders to help answer his question.  The post is also upvoted showing that many other users recognize that it is a well formulated post/question.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad-stuff">The Bad Stuff</h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed about this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77063438/im-having-problems-implementing-classes-in-c">question</a> was that the user posted his entire project description and the requirements into the question.  This was a red flag for me because it already told me there wasn’t going to be a specific question being asked.  Furthermore, there was not a clear question asked.  Instead, there were multiple points made about what does not work in the code.  Although there were not many aggressive responses to this question, the post was downvoted meaning it was not a good question.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The biggest pet peeve I have noticed when it comes to stackoverflow questions is when people ask for homework answers rather than actual help on problems.  That was sort of highlighted in the “bad question” section and like stated before it is normally a red flag when it comes to stackoverflow.  Personally, I think the best questions to ask are the concise ones about certain concepts rather than huge broad problems.  They are questions that can be easily understood and answered and can provide the biggest benefit in terms of learning.</p>
