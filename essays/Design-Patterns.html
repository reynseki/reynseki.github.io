<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Design patterns in software engineering are important for a variety of reasons.  Some of these reasons include but are not limited to, structure, consistency, and readability.  A lot of the benefits from this address things both in a team environment but also as a coder individually.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-point">Whatâ€™s the point</h2>
<p>The main point of design patterns is to help clean up your code and keep everything organized.  As I have touched on in a previous essay, while writing code, there are certain standards that should be followed.  In a way, they are sort of like unwritten rules.  It helps you understand your code better while also allowing others who may view your code to understand what is going on as well.  It also provides consistency if everyone follows similar standards because it keeps everything uniform so there is no confusion amongst anyone.</p>

<h2 id="basketball">Basketball</h2>
<p>As a real world example, design patterns act similarly to a sports playbook.  In team sports such as football or basketball, the team functions successfully because everyone is on the same page.  On an individual level everyone is consistent with how they play which leads to uniform play amongst everyone.  Even if everyone did their job, if they were only focused on themselves and not the team, nothing would be able to run smoothly since no one would be on the same page.  This is similar to software engineering because the team functions the best when everyone knows what the other person is doing and is able to efficiently read how they are working.  On an individual level this is also similar because just like in coding, athletes strive for the most consistency as possible so they are able to do their job well.  Keeping consistency in coding allows for your teammates to always know what you are doing but also allows for you to have an easier time parsing your own code.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As group projects have slowly been introduced to us in our software engineering course, I have been able to tell how a disconnect between team members can be detrimental to the project that is being worked on.  For example, if someone needs to connect different components, if they cannot read the component that you were responsible for, it can cause a multitude of problems.  This only worsens when more and more people start to have issues reading your code.  All in all, design patterns should be followed both individually and as a team.  As I continue my software engineering journey, I will continue to develop a playbook that works both for myself and my future teammates.</p>
