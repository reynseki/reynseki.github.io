<h2 id="how-it-all-started">How it all Started</h2>
<p>Growing up, the thought of being a computer engineer was nowhere near the forefront of what I wanted to do.  My days in preschool were filled playing with blocks and legos, therefore at the mature age of five I knew I wanted to be an architect.  But as I grew older, the world also grew around me.  Technology took over and instead of playing with blocks and legos, I started surrounding myself with my computer, phone, and video games.  By the time I was in high school, I knew technology would only become a bigger part of the world and that becoming a computer engineer would be the best way to involve myself in that space.</p>

<h2 id="there-and-back-again">There and Back Again</h2>
<p>However, the journey here was not a straight shot.  After taking a few computer science classes my first year in college I did not think the major would be for me and left for a few years.  After being directionless for a few years not knowing what I wanted to do, I decided to go back to computer science.  So far, although not easy, my (second) time in computer science has taught me a lot both within the major and outside of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-reasons">The Reasons</h2>
<p>Some of the main reasons I became interested in computer science is because of the growth of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.  Both have come a long way in a short time and keeping up with their evolution over the years really made me want to pursue a career in computer science.  Aside from technology being as relevant as it has ever been in modern society, a more simple reason that I decided to get into the space is that having grown up with technology it has been and currently is a big part of my life, so it only made sense to pursue a career in the computer science field.</p>
