<h2 id="new-beginnings">New Beginnings</h2>
<p>As with learning anything new, there comes the feelings of anxiety, uncomfortableness, and uncertainty with what lies ahead.  For computer scientists, this happens more often than others.  Constantly having to learn new coding languages or techniques to keep up with the times, some would say we are crazy.  But unlike languages you speak such as English or Japanese, coding languages more often than not build on each other.  After a while, it makes constantly diving into the unknown a little easier each time.</p>

<h2 id="jump-of-faith">Jump of Faith</h2>
<p>As a “complete newbie” to JavaScript, learning this language was definitely categorized as jumping into the unknown for me.  Aside from the knowledge that JavaScript was used for websites I knew nothing about the language and what to expect.  But after familiarizing myself more with the language, I realized how much it related back to previous coding languages I have learned such as C and Java.  In fact it took little time for me to realize how much more flexible Javascript felt.  I really realized this when I found out you could return multiple types in one function such as being able to return a string value or an integer value.  However this does not mean learning the language was a walk in the park.</p>

<h2 id="not-all-smooth-sailing">Not all Smooth Sailing</h2>
<p>After not taking a coding class for close to a year and a half, it took a little bit to get back into the swing of things.  One thing that really helped in this regard was the WODs given in my software engineering class.  Outside of the actual exercise, it made me want to be more prepared before class since the exercises were done not alone but with partner(s).  Doing the actual exercises helped me in various ways such as improving my problem solving skills and being an efficient programmer since the exercises were timed.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>If there is anything to take away from this, it is that jumping into the unknown is not a bad thing.  It shows us that we are continuing to move forward with ourselves.  While I do not know if I will continue to love JavaScript or start to dislike it as time goes on, I do know my attempt at learning it will make me a better programmer in the long run.  I also know that the next time I need to learn or familiarize myself with a new coding language, it will be that much easier.</p>
