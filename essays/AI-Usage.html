  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>In today’s day and age, AI is becoming more and more prevalent as time goes on.  Art generation and chatbots lead the charge in terms of usage but the possibilities in which the technology can be utilized is endless.  In terms of education and this class specifically, ChatGPT (a chatbot) is what I personally have used the most.</p>

<h2 id="experience-wods">Experience WODs</h2>
<p>I did not use ChatGPT because of the abundance of time that we had to work for these assignments.  Since there was no time limit and we had as much time as we needed to complete the work, I normally tried to tackle these assignments without the use of AI.  It felt like a good way to learn and experiment with new concepts.</p>

<h2 id="in-class-practice-wods">In-Class Practice WODs</h2>
<p>I did not use AI for in-class practice WODs because most of them allowed for discussion amongst our tables, so it felt more valuable to dissect issues with people around me than to just turn to AI to finish the WOD quickly.  I thought this ended up being beneficial because I was able to learn a lot just from discussing aspects of the practice WOD with those around me who had a better understanding of that week’s concepts.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-wods">Weekly WODs</h2>
<p>For weekly WODs I did use AI for some of them.  One of the main reasons was the time constraint and the material being sort of new still.  Using AI allowed for pinpoint questions to be asked about certain concepts, or even more specific questions about the concept itself.  In case a line of code had an error, or if I forgot how something is supposed to be implemented, AI was a resource that was able to provide answers quickly during the WOD instead of having to google the issue and search for answers.</p>

<h2 id="final-project">Final Project</h2>
<p>For the final project so far I have not used any AI tools for assistance but as we progress I think there is a chance that I will.  Since we are making use of certain resources that we did not use in class, it is definitely a possibility that I will be using AI for some sort of assistance later on.</p>

<h2 id="learning-a-concepttutorial">Learning a concept/Tutorial</h2>
<p>I think AI has been extremely helpful when learning about new concepts in this class.  Since a lot of documentation can be overwhelming or vague sometimes, using something like ChatGPT for clarification is very helpful.  Another reason for this is availability, sometimes asking TAs or Professors for help may be difficult because of the time or other circumstances, but there is never a bad time to ask AI for clarification/assistance.</p>

<h2 id="answering-a-question-in-class-or-in-discord">Answering a question in class or in Discord</h2>
<p>I did not use AI to help answer a question in class or in discord.  Although I support the use of AI in learning confusing topics and elaborating on things, I still believe that we should be able to answer questions on our own.  Relying that heavily on AI is where certain problems can occur.</p>

<h2 id="asking-or-answering-a-smart-question">Asking or answering a smart-question</h2>
<p>I did not use AI in regards to asking or answering a smart-question.  I did think that the questions section in the discord was extremely helpful however.  It allowed me to look back and see if other students had similar questions to myself which would save me the time of having to ask the same questions again.</p>

<h2 id="coding-example-eg-give-an-example-of-using-underscorepluck">Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore.pluck”</h2>
<p>I did not use AI to show me examples of code during this semester.  However I think this is only because in a lot of the assignments and practice WODs we were given examples that we could refer to on how certain concepts work.  Such as when we were learning the underscore functions.  If these examples were not given during these assignments, I think I would have used AI more frequently to help show examples of how certain code works.</p>

<h2 id="explaining-code">Explaining Code</h2>
<p>I have used AI to help explain sections of code.  I think it was helpful because the alternative would be trying to understand each piece of the code and try to put it together sort of like a puzzle.  But with AI it does that for you more efficiently and in a manner that is easier to understand and learn from.</p>

<h2 id="writing-code">Writing Code</h2>
<p>I have used AI to help write code in certain situations.  For example, on some of the assignments and WODs, if there was a certain line or function of code I that was not working, I would use ChatGPT to see what the error was.  Depending on the situation I would also give it the prompt that I was answering and compare the code from itself to my own and see where the discrepancy was.</p>

<h2 id="documenting-code">Documenting Code</h2>
<p>I did not use AI for assistance in documenting code.  For the most part, I think even with the assistance of AI in certain assignments I was still able to have a decent understanding of what was going on.  So when having to comment on certain pieces of code, I was able to do so without AI.  However I do see myself possibly using AI for this in the future.</p>

<h2 id="quality-assurance">Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>I did use AI for quality assurance throughout this semester.  In the beginning to middle of the semester more so than towards the end I would say.  When I was just getting started with Javascript, HTML, and CSS, that was when I would use AI a lot because I was still unfamiliar with the languages.  ChatGPT helped a lot with fixing errors that I did not understand and helping to dissect certain issues that I would otherwise have been stuck on for a while.</p>

<h2 id="other-uses-in-314">Other Uses in 314</h2>
<p>I believe that the above answers cover most of the bases on how I used AI this past semester.  I believe that AI has a lot of potential as a resource we can use but also is dangerous because of how quickly it can be used as a hard crutch in terms of learning and coding.  Finding a balance between the two is probably the most important thing when dealing with AI.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-learning-and-understanding">Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned before I believe AI can be a really valuable tool in helping to learn new concepts.  It can simplify “hard to understand” lectures and provide examples almost anyone can understand.  However, the dark side of this is if it is used the wrong way.  For example, someone can ask it to do their assignment or write their paper.  It is a double edged sword that can work both ways.</p>

<h2 id="practical-applications">Practical Applications</h2>
<p>Some practical applications I can think of are how AI can take over some simple jobs.  They can also shorten jobs that sometimes take a long time to complete, such as coding and art.  This can also be dangerous because it puts people’s jobs at risk because it fully automates what they would normally consider their jobs.</p>

<h2 id="challengers-and-opportunities">Challengers and Opportunities</h2>
<p>One limitation I have seen so far, specifically in ChatGPT, is how you need to carefully word the question you are trying to ask.  Depending on how the question is worded, there are a variety of different ways the chatbot can interpret the question.  This can be bad because this means sometimes it may give a wrong answer depending on how the question is worded.</p>

<h2 id="comparative-analysis">Comparative Analysis</h2>
<p>I think that AI enhanced education is a double edged sword.  While on one hand, people are able to learn concepts easier and ask questions whenever they choose, I believe that there is less practical skill development and knowledge retention.  This is because instead of doing a lot of practice there is a tendency to use the AI for more than is necessary.  Like what has been said above numerous times, while there is almost unlimited potential for AI and ChatGPT to be an educational tool, there is also unlimited potential for it to be a tool for the opposite thing.</p>

<h2 id="future-considerations">Future Considerations</h2>
<p>I think AI will continue to be prominent in software engineering courses and also educational courses in general.  I believe the current system of letting students use AI however they want is fine.  However it is in their hands on how they use it.  I don’t think there is a good way to “limit” how AI is used.  Just depends on the student and how they want to shape their future in a sense.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>AI is definitely here to stay and is something that we will have to get accustomed to, both from an educator’s point of view and a student’s point of view.  I believe that this course is doing justice by implementing AI into the course rather than fight against it.  While a balance still needs to be found it is exciting to think about where this technology will be in the years to come.  It is still in its infancy and is able to achieve so much, so it is almost impossible to predict what might happen in the years ahead as it evolves.</p>
