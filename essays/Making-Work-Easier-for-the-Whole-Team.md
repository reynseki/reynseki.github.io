## Keeping things Organized
While organization might be considered a nuisance or “too much extra work”, it is a necessity when working in groups or anything that may involve people besides yourself.  Organization allows for people to have easy access to tools or resources they might need and overall removes the possibility of confusion when working.  In almost all workplaces this can be seen because certain things such as documents and files are always moved around between people and offices, so everything must be kept organized so if someone needs to access something it is not a tedious task.  

## Team Environments
The concept of organization is especially important in the field of computer science because of how much work is done in groups or teams.  This means that everyone must be able to have a good understanding of the code being written.  To simplify this even further, everyone following a certain “coding style” makes it easier for everyone to look through someone else’s code.  For example, if a team of five people all followed different coding standards/styles, the code would look like a mess because of how different everyone’s parts look.  But if everyone conformed to a certain coding style, everything looks more homologous and it is easier for everyone to work on.

## ESLint 
So far I am enjoying ESLint with IntelliJ.  It allows for my code to look more neat and structured.  So far it has not been too hard to get the green check mark but I have started to notice how bad my coding style used to be before.  Everything was a lot more packed together and harder to read, but now it is a bit easier on the eyes.  I can agree that while ESLint comes with a few downsides such as extra work, it is worth it in the end because while using it you are learning better habits in terms of coding.  However I disagree that it helps learn the language itself.  It feels like you should already have a decent grasp on the coding language before using ESLint, and using it just cleans up some of the formatting.  

## The Perspective
I definitely see the use of “coding standards” in computer science.  Although it may not seem like it now since most of our work is being done as individuals, down the road I can really see the benefits of everyone sharing a certain style of coding.  As projects become bigger and teams become larger, everyone having a homologous way of writing code will make the job much easier.
