<h2 id="the-road-so-far">The Road So Far</h2>
<p>Throughout this semester I have learned a variety of skills that I can see myself using beyond the classroom and college itself.  I also have learned a lot more about software engineering and what that really means.  Going into the class, I was really only expecting to learn how to design a website, but I found that software engineering encompasses a lot more aspects than just that.  From concepts such as coding standards to ethics, there is a lot more that goes into software engineering than most would think.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standards">Coding Standards</h2>
<p>One concept I learned that I thought was really important and will stick with me throughout my career was coding standards.  Until taking this class, I was only focused on how I myself was able to read the code.  I did not care about how it was formatted or structured as long as I was able to understand it.  Eventually, beginning with ESLint, I started to notice how messy my code was.  While in my eyes it looked organized, there were a lot of aspects that were messy in the broader sense such as extra spaces between code, random indentations, and lines of code that were really crammed together to name a few things.  Although I began to clean up my code, I did not really think much of it because either way I was able to understand the code I was writing.  Finally, when we reached the final project, it all came together and I realized how important coding standards were.  Working in a group with multiple moving parts opened my eyes on how the way I write code can make collaborating with others much easier or much more difficult.  One of the biggest benefits to coding standards is that it makes code universally readable for both yourself and your teammates.  Since everyone will be writing their own code but accessing each other’s work, writing code using the same standard helps everyone out when it comes to reviewing and editing each other’s work.</p>

<h2 id="ethics-in-software-engineering">Ethics in Software Engineering</h2>
<p>In today’s day and age, almost everyone in the world relies on technology.  This can range from typical customer service to social media work to defense contracting.  This is where ethics comes into play.  When most people see these jobs, they just think of opportunity and how much money can be made.  However, an idea that should be thought about more often is the implications that come with some of these jobs.  While a job such as IT work is more grounded, jobs such as social media and defense work are a lot more controversial than one might think.  With social media, you are developing software built to figure out people’s interests and personal information.  For example, one topic that has been discussed more and more is how ads sites are able to tailor ads towards your interests and history.  Some people even call this technology invasive, this is one of the things you might be working on in that industry.  Defense contracting is an even more controversial field.  An example our professor provided us is the ethics behind developing technology used to aim missiles, a job that will by all means cause lives to be taken.  This is where certain personal morals come into play and it comes down to what you are ok living with.  Artificial Intelligence may be the most controversial topic regarding ethics in today’s society.  With everyone having seen the movie Terminator, the implications that human life is at threat is the thought that is going through a lot of people’s minds, with the short term and also more realistic threat being, AI taking people’s jobs.  With artificial Intelligence starting to become increasingly popular in society, seeing how the ethical discussions regarding sentient life and consciousness unfold will be interesting to see.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-the-world">The Future of the World</h2>
<p>Although learning about coding standards will stick with me throughout my future and career, the ethical discussions, albeit short, will be what I think about the most going forward, especially with artificial intelligence.  This class more than others was open to the use of artificial intelligence, and I think that is why it is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of ethics in computer engineering.  Referencing a Star Trek episode where it is debated whether someone is man or machine, I believe artificial intelligence will reach that point in the coming years and we are not that far away.  I am both excited and scared to see where we as humans will stand when that day comes.</p>
