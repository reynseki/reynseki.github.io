# Second Homework WOD

This is the second WOD (Workout of the day) that we had to complete for homework for ICS314 Software Engineering.  The objective of this workout was to implement an algorithm that would parse a string and figure out if all the characters in the string were unique.  Initially I wanted overthought how to approach the problem and thought about using two arrays to compare the characters.  The first array would hold the inital string and the second array would hold the characters already parsed while checking if there were duplicates.
