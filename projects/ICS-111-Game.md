# Dodgeball
This project was made a long time ago during my ICS 111 class.  It implements the java language, eclipse, and EZGraphics.  The EZGraphics allow for more options when programming games in Java/Eclipse.  

# Instructions
The objective of the game is to dodge incoming objects moving horizontally from left to right.  If you get hit by an object you lose health and every time you move you lose stamina.  You can also pick up powerups that spawn which will replenish health and stamina.  When your health drops to 0 a game over screen will appear signalling you losing the game.
